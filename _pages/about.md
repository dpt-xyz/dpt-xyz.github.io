<p align="justify"> I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at <a href = "https://www.iiit.ac.in/"> IIIT Hyderabad</a>, working with <a href ="https://ravika.github.io/"> Prof. Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhatla</a> in the Center for Visual Information Technology <a href = "https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/"> (CVIT)</a>. My research focuses on addressing safety challenges in autonomous systems, particularly in unstructured navigation scenarios. </p> 

<p align="justify"> My work leverages perceptual cues to develop learning-based solutions for real-world scenarios. This includes <i>traffic violation detection for two-wheelers</i>, <i>context-aware modeling of riders and motorcycles in occluded traffic scenarios</i>, and <i>designing framework to probe Vision LLMs' capabilities in understanding diverse road conditions</i>. Broadly, my goal is to achieve trustable autonomous driving systems. </p>

<p align="justify"> Outside of research, I enjoy running, reading, and spending time with friends. </p>
